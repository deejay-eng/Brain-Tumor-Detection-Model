The brain tumor detection model achieved an impressive accuracy of 96% on the test dataset, indicating strong predictive performance. This high accuracy demonstrates the model’s capability to distinguish between tumor and non-tumor MRI scans effectively. The model was trained on a balanced dataset with appropriate preprocessing techniques such as resizing, normalization, and data augmentation to prevent overfitting. The 4x4 grid of classified MRI images visually confirms the model’s accuracy, with most predictions aligning well with ground truth labels. A few misclassifications occurred in cases with unclear or ambiguous features, which could be improved with further data and fine-tuning. Overall, the results validate the reliability of the model for practical diagnostic support.
